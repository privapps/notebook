#### A Simple End-to-End Encrypted Notebook

Privacy is a fundamental right that belongs to every individual from birth. However, this right has been compromised repeatedly over time, affecting a significant portion of the global population who live under heavy surveillance and censorship.

This application offers an end-to-end encrypted notebook that ensures only authorized users can view, edit, or share its content. As long as your `E2E key` or device remains secure, no one else can access the notebook's contents.

You can also use it as a regular notebook or a simple site builder with markdown support. For more information, visit [Privapps Notebook Github](https://github.com/privapps/notebook).

#### Use Cases
- Use it as a personal private notebook. For example, for daily notes, family secrets, etc.
- Personal lockbox. You can store private information such as passport numbers, etc.
- Share your notes with some of your friends for a limited time.
- Many more possibilities not listed here.

#### How It Works
- You create or modify the notebook in your browser on your local computer. Then you can choose to save it as a file or publish it to the web.
- If you save to a file, you can choose plain text or encrypted formats. If you choose to publish to the web:
  - The `E2E key` is used for end-to-end encryption or decryption of the content. If you don't set that, it would function as a regular notebook. Note that even without an `E2E key`, the system administrator or network monitor cannot decrypt the content because encryption and decryption occur in your **browser**.
- This notebook is fully integrated with [PrivateBin](https://privatebin.info/). You can save the data in PrivateBin and then decrypt and view it from this app.

##### Using Files as Storage
- You can read or write a notebook and then save or load from a local file.
- The `E2E key` is strongly recommended as it provides better protection.
- Once you load the content, you can modify the note or save it with a different `E2E key`.

##### Using It from the Web
- When creating it, you can start writing a notebook from scratch or load it from a pre-saved file.
- There are two ways to share the notebook:
  1. If this app is configured with PrivateBin, you can directly save it from the app. Then the shareable URL will appear at the top right of your screen.
  2. You can also gather the note data and publish it to a publicly available PrivateBin. This app can load from the public URL and translate it into another URL that you can share.

##### Important Warning!
When editing a notebook, all your working data is stored in memory. If you refresh the page, go to another site, or close your browser, all your data will be **lost**.
